# Browse Playbooks (the base library)

The user wants to see what's built-in. Implexa ships with 30 base Playbooks across 7 verticals — atomic, composite, and outcome tiers. Each one is fully invocable as-is, or forkable for customization.

## Step 1 — List the system Playbooks

Call **`list_org_skills`** with:
- `query`: optional — filter to a specific topic if the user mentioned one
- `tags`: optional — filter to a vertical or tier (e.g. `['gtm']`, `['talent']`, `['composite']`)
- `includePrivate`: false
- `limit`: 50

The Playbooks have `scope: 'system'` and `organizationId: 'system'` — they appear alongside the user's own org skills but are tagged distinctly.

If the user asked for a specific vertical (sales, recruiting, customer success, etc.) → filter by tag.
If they're browsing → show grouped by vertical.

## Step 2 — Render grouped by vertical

Group the results by `tags[0]` (the vertical) and render a clean catalog:

```
🎯 GTM (10 Playbooks)
   • Research a prospect          (atomic)    — 4-6 sentences of context, ready to drop into a cold email
   • Draft a cold email           (atomic)    — 4-sentence outreach in your voice
   • Find decision-makers         (atomic)    — 3-5 budget owners at a target
   • Full account research        (composite) — comprehensive prep for discovery call
   • Pre-call prep                (composite) — one-screen brief from a calendar event
   • Cold outreach sequence       (composite) — 5-touch personalized sequence
   • Account expansion play       (composite) — find new buying centers at existing customers
   • Land the meeting             (outcome)   — end-to-end SDR workflow

🎯 Talent Acquisition (5 Playbooks)
   • Source candidates by skill   (atomic)    — 10-20 ranked candidates
   • Fill this Bullhorn role      (composite) — Bullhorn DB + external + draft submittal
   • Redeploy a candidate         (composite) — find next role for ending engagement
   • Interview prep brief         (composite) — interviewer briefing
   • Daily Bullhorn standup       (outcome)   — book-of-business briefing

🎯 Customer Success (4 Playbooks)
   • ...

🎯 Product Engineering (2 Playbooks)
🎯 People Ops (2 Playbooks)
🎯 Finance / FP&A (2 Playbooks)
🎯 Marketing (3 Playbooks)
```

For each line, include the slug somewhere clickable so the user can pick one to apply or fork.

## Step 3 — Offer the next move

End with:

> *"Three things you can do with any Playbook:*
> 1. *Run it directly — say 'run [slug]' and I'll execute against whatever target you give me*
> 2. *Fork it into your org for customization — say 'fork [slug]'*
> 3. *Demonstrate your version once and I'll save a brand new skill — `$implexa-record-skill`*"*

## Step 4 — Handle the user's choice

If they say "run X" → call **`apply_org_skill`** with skillSlug=X
If they say "fork X" → call **`fork_org_skill`** with sourceSkillId=X (in the org_skills collection, look up by slug)
If they ask "what's the difference between [tier]" — explain:
- **Atomic**: 30-60 second runs, single tool chain, single output
- **Composite**: multi-tool workflows, 2-5 minutes, "saves my whole afternoon" scope
- **Outcome**: end-to-end orchestrations with branching/retry — the hero demos

## What's next?

- `Run a Playbook against my target company`
- `Fork a Playbook so I can customize it for my style`
- `Show me my org's own skills (not just Playbooks)`

## Notes for the model

- **System Playbooks vs org skills**: Playbooks have `scope='system'`, the user's saved skills have `scope='org'` or `'private'`. Both show up in list_org_skills. Distinguish them in the rendering — Playbooks are the base library; org skills are what the team built.
- **Don't dump all 30 unless asked.** Default to grouped/summarized view. If the user wants details on a specific vertical, drill in.
- **Outcome tier = demo material.** When a user asks "what's most impressive", surface the outcome-tier Playbooks first. They're the 30-second screen-recording moments.
- **Forking is the activation.** When a user finds a Playbook they like, encourage forking. A forked Playbook becomes their own skill — discoverable in their org, customizable, attributable.

## Error handling

| Error                              | Diagnosis                       | Tell the user                                                                                                |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `list_org_skills` returns 0 system Playbooks | Seed script hasn't run yet | Tell user: "Base Playbooks aren't loaded on this backend — your team can run `node scripts/seed-base-playbooks.js --confirm`." |
| User asks for a Playbook that doesn't exist | Bad slug or removed Playbook | Suggest 2-3 closest matches by name.                                                                          |
