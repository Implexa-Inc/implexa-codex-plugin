name: fork
description: Fork (clone) any skill into your own org so you can customize it. Use when the user says "fork this skill", "make a copy", "I want my own version", "customize this skill", "duplicate this", or wants to start from a base Playbook and personalize it. Source can be a system Playbook, one of your own org skills, or another org's skill via a share token. Lineage is recorded — the dashboard shows where every fork came from.

# Fork a skill into your org

The user wants their own customizable copy of an existing skill. Fork it.

## Step 1 — Resolve the source skill

There are four kinds of input to handle:

**1a. Explicit pointer** — slug, ID, or a recently-mentioned skill name.
- Slug → use as `sourceSkillSlug`
- Mongo ID → use as `sourceSkillId`
- "Fork that one" (vague) → look back at the most recent skill name in the
  conversation, confirm with the user.

**1b. Share link** — if they pasted `implexa.ai/s/<token>`, don't fork directly.
Tell them: *"Use the Install button on that page — it does the fork after login."*

**1c. Fuzzy query** — the user said something like *"fork the hackernews skill"*
or *"fork the prospecting one"*. The skill might be in their library, their
org's, or in the public/Trending Globally library. Resolve by searching:

  - Call **`list_org_skills`** with `query: "<their words>"` and
    `includeUniversal: true`. The flag widens the search to include public
    skills from any org, so HackerNews-style seeds (curated by Implexa Team or
    other orgs) become forkable by slug.
  - Render the results as a numbered list with scope + author + usage:

    ```
    Found these matching "hackernews" — pick one to fork:

      1. 🌍 Daily HN comment drafter      — by Implexa Team · 41 runs
      2. 🌍 HN trending Claude posts      — by Implexa Team · 16 runs
      3. 👥 Bug triage from Jira          — your org · 8 runs

    Reply with a number, or describe more precisely.
    ```

  - When the user picks, resolve to that skill's slug → Step 2.
  - **Exactly 1 strong match** (query appears in name or trigger phrases) → just
    fork it directly without asking. Don't make the user pick from a list of 1.

**1d. Truly nothing found** — after the universal-scope search returns zero,
tell the user: *"No skill matches 'X' in your library, your org's, or the
public library. Want to capture this workflow as a new skill via
`$implexa-record-skill` instead?"*

## Step 2 — Call fork_org_skill

Call **`fork_org_skill`** with:
- `sourceSkillId` OR `sourceSkillSlug` (one is required)
- `scope`: 'private' default — only the forker sees it. Pass 'org' if they explicitly said "for the whole team"
- `newName`: optional — if user wants a custom name, otherwise auto-generates as "<original> (forked)"
- `personalizations`: optional — any notes about how they want to customize

## Step 3 — Show what was forked

Display:
- New skill name + slug
- Status: draft (always — they need to activate to make it discoverable)
- Lineage: "forked from [source name] in [source org / system Playbooks]"
- Content preview (first 800 chars)

## Step 4 — Suggest the next move

> *"Two options:*
> 1. *Activate it as-is — say 'activate it'*
> 2. *Edit it first — tell me what you want to change and I'll suggest updates"*

If they want edits — note them and offer to use `$implexa-record-skill` to demonstrate the customized version. (Forking + immediate re-demonstration is the strongest path to a personalized skill.)

## What's next?

- `Activate the forked skill so my team can use it`
- `Show me how the forked skill differs from the original`
- `Demonstrate my version of this workflow once to refine the skill`

## Notes for the model

- **Forking is cheap.** Encourage forks of system Playbooks early — gives the user a personalized starting point without writing anything.
- **Forks default to private.** This avoids polluting the org skill list with one-off experiments. Activate to org scope only when the user says "make this available to the team".
- **Lineage is permanent.** Every fork records its source. The dashboard shows fork chains — useful for understanding which Playbooks compound and which die.
- **Don't fork a skill someone just shared with you via DM.** That requires the proper install flow at implexa.ai/s/<token>/install — different code path.

## Error handling

| Error                                     | Diagnosis                                  | Tell the user                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Source skill not found or not visible`    | Bad ID/slug, or cross-org skill without share token | "I can't see that skill. If it's from another org, you need a share link." |
| `Forbidden — only the creator can share private skills` | Trying to fork someone else's private skill | "That skill is private to its creator. Ask them to share it with you instead." |
