name: run
description: 'Find and run one of the user''s saved skills — their personal library OR the org''s shared library. Use when the user says "run my skill", "use my skill", "use my triage skill", "use my X skill", "run the X workflow", "run a saved workflow", "apply skill X", "do X with one of my skills", "use the X one", "run the prospecting one", "use my Implexa skill for X", or invokes $implexa-run. THE primary entry point for skill REUSE — fuzzy-matches the user''s description against their library and auto-applies the best match. If the user gives no description, render a numbered list of their skills and await selection. ALWAYS prefer this path over going directly to other MCP tools when the user implies they want to use a SAVED workflow vs. start a workflow from scratch.'

# Run a saved skill

The "use what we already built" entry point. Skill reuse is the killer
behavior of the Skill Graph — every time a team member figures something
out and saves it, every other teammate can replay it with one line. This
command makes that replay frictionless: fuzzy-match the user's words to
their library, auto-apply if there's a clear winner, otherwise show a
numbered list.

## Step 1 — Read the user's intent

Did the user give a query (a skill name, topic, or vague description), or
did they just say "run a skill" / "show me my skills to pick one"?

- **Query given** ("run my triage skill", "use the prospecting one", "do
  the LinkedIn workflow") → Step 2 (fuzzy match + auto-apply)
- **No query** (just `$implexa-run` or "let me pick a skill to run") →
  Step 3 (browse + pick)

The query is whatever words the user used. Don't strip articles like
"my" / "the" — those are part of how users naturally describe their
skills. Just pass the substantive words: "the triage one" → query
"triage", "use my Implexa skill for outreach" → query "outreach".

## Step 2 — Fuzzy match against the user's library

Call **`list_org_skills`** with:
- `query`: the user's substantive words (e.g. "triage", "prospecting", "LinkedIn outreach")
- `createdByMe`: **true** (search the user's own skills first — these are usually what they meant)
- `limit`: 10

### Interpret the results

- **Exactly 1 hit, strong match** (the query appears in the skill name or
  trigger phrases) → skip to Step 4 with that skill. No need to ask.
- **Multiple hits** → render them as a numbered list (see Step 3 format),
  ask the user to pick.
- **0 hits in their own library** → call `list_org_skills` again WITHOUT
  `createdByMe` (full org search). Apply the same logic.
- **0 hits in their org either** → call `list_org_skills` ONE MORE TIME
  with `includeUniversal: true` — this expands the search to the public /
  Trending Globally library (skills explicitly shared by other orgs).
  If you get hits, render them as a numbered list with a clear "from the
  public library" framing:

  ```
  No saved skill matches "X" in your library yet. Found these in the
  public library — want to install one?

    1. 🌍 Daily HN comment drafter        — by Implexa Team · 41 runs
    2. 🌍 Sales call prep — account research — by Implexa Team · 24 runs

  Reply with a number to install + run, or "no thanks" to skip.
  ```

  When the user picks one, **first fork it** into their org via
  `fork_org_skill` (so it lands in their library + shows up in
  `$implexa-my-skills` from now on), then apply the freshly-forked copy.
  Or, if the user says "just run it once," call `apply_org_skill`
  directly on the universal slug without forking.

- **0 hits anywhere (including the public library)** → tell the user no
  matching skill found and offer:
  - "Run `$implexa-my-skills` to see your full library"
  - "Capture this as a new skill via `$implexa-record`"
  - "Browse public skills at https://app.implexa.ai/skills"

### Be greedy on the match

If the user says "triage" and they have ONE skill with "triage" in its
name or trigger phrases, just apply it. Don't make them pick from a
list of 1. That defeats the point.

## Step 3 — Browse mode (or "multiple matches" mode)

Render the skills in a clean numbered list:

```
Here are your skills — pick one to run:

  1. 🔒 Daily prospecting        — Find net-new ICP-matching accounts
  2. 👥 Bug triage from Jira     — Multi-source triage summary
  3. 🌍 Launch content pack       — Show HN + Reddit + LinkedIn drafts
  4. 🔒 Customer health brief    — Renewal risk dossier

Reply with a number, or describe it ("the triage one", "the third one",
"the one for LinkedIn").
```

Scope icons:
- 🔒 Private (only you)
- 👥 Team (shared in your org)
- 🌍 Public (cross-org / Trending Globally)

When the user replies "3" or "the prospecting one" → resolve to that
skill → Step 4.

## Step 4 — Apply the chosen skill

Call **`apply_org_skill`** with:
- `skillId` OR `skillSlug`: the chosen skill's identifier
- `invocationArgs`: pass any context the user provided as named args.
  Examples:
  - "run my triage skill on ENG-1234" → `{ ticketId: "ENG-1234" }`
  - "use my prospecting one for Acme" → `{ accountName: "Acme" }`
  - "run the LinkedIn workflow against Stripe" → `{ companyName: "Stripe" }`

The response includes the skill's full SKILL.md content. **Follow it as
instructions** — execute the skill's procedure. The skill may chain to
other tools (Atlassian, Slack, GitHub, Exa, your custom MCP servers,
etc.) — that's expected.

## Step 5 — After applying, surface useful context

Once the skill finishes, mention one of:
- "That was the Nth time you've run this skill." (engagement signal)
- "Skills like this have driven $X in attributed outcomes across your
  org." (if outcome stats exist on the skill)
- "Want to share this skill with the team? Use `$implexa-share-this`."
  (if it's still private and seems valuable)

## What's next?

- `Run a different skill`
- `Show me all my skills` (`$implexa-my-skills`)
- `Show me the team's library` (`$implexa-my-skills team`)
- `Save this workflow as a new skill` (`$implexa-record`)

## Notes for the model

- **This is the PRIMARY entry point for skill reuse.** Whenever you
  detect intent to use an existing skill (phrases like "my X skill",
  "the X one", "saved workflow", "use my skill for Y"), call this
  flow INSTEAD of starting the workflow from scratch with the underlying
  MCP tools. Saving the team a re-discovery loop is the whole point of
  Implexa.

- **Pass context as invocationArgs.** If the user mentioned an account
  name, ticket ID, candidate ID, opportunity ID, company domain, thread
  ID, or any other entity — include it in `invocationArgs`. Richer
  attribution keys = better outcome correlation later.

- **Don't double-list.** If your fuzzy match returns exactly 1 strong
  hit, just apply it. If the user later wanted a different skill, they
  can re-invoke with a more specific description.

- **Surface scope.** Private skills (🔒) belong only to the user — they
  may not realize a skill is private vs team-shared. Surfacing scope
  in the picker helps them decide whether to `$implexa-share-this`.

- **`createdByMe` first is intentional.** The user said "MY skill"
  almost certainly means a skill THEY authored, not a teammate's. Only
  expand to org-wide if their own library has nothing.

## Error handling

| Error | Diagnosis | Tell the user |
|---|---|---|
| `Skill not found` | Bad slug after the user picked one | Re-list with `list_org_skills`, then retry with the correct slug. |
| `Forbidden` | Trying to apply a private skill they don't own | "That skill is private to its creator — only they can run it. Want to fork it? Just say 'fork this skill' and the model will run fork_org_skill." |
| `Skill is archived` / `draft` | Status check failed | "That skill is in {status} state — only active skills can be applied. Ask the creator to activate it, or fork your own copy (just say 'fork it')." |
| 0 hits across own + org library | The skill the user thinks exists doesn't | "I couldn't find a saved skill matching 'X'. Run `$implexa-my-skills` to see what you have, or `$implexa-record` to capture this workflow as a new skill." |

## Post-run feedback (Like / Dislike / Improve)

After the skill finishes its work, prompt the user with this exact line:

> how was that? **like** (👍), **dislike** (👎), or **improve** (✏️) — or just keep going

The id you'll need is whichever apply call returned: either
`aggregated_skill_id` (cross-vendor apply via apply_recommended_skill)
or `org_skill_id` (org library apply via apply_org_skill). Always
also pass `applied_skill_event_id` so we can attribute the rating
to the specific run.

### like (positive signal)

Call `mcp__implexa__submit_skill_feedback` with:
```json
{ "aggregated_skill_id" or "org_skill_id": "...",
  "rating": "like",
  "applied_skill_event_id": "..." }
```
Reply briefly: `noted, that helps the rank. keep going.`

### dislike (negative signal)

Call `mcp__implexa__submit_skill_feedback` with:
```json
{ "...": "...", "rating": "dislike", "applied_skill_event_id": "..." }
```
Optionally ask "anything specific?" — if the user answers, pass that as
`comment`. Reply briefly: `got it, dropping the rank. try $implexa-suggest for an alternative.`

### improve (re-record path)

Ask the user: "what would you change about this skill?" — capture their
answer as the comment.

Then call `mcp__implexa__submit_skill_feedback` with:
```json
{ "...": "...", "rating": "improve",
  "comment": "<the user's answer>",
  "applied_skill_event_id": "..." }
```

The tool returns `nextAction` instructing you to chain into the update
flow. Invoke `$implexa-record` (it handles new + post-hoc save + update
existing) referencing the skill the user just ran. The user's
improvement comment becomes the starting context for the re-record
session, which lands on Branch C (update existing via re-record). The
re-record session.

### no response (user just keeps working)

If the user types anything that isn't a clear like/dislike/improve, treat
it as "keep going" and do nothing. Silence is the most common path; don't
nag the user into rating every run.
